My friends and I were so excited because it meant finally being free from homework and tests for two whole months. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we got to the park, some parent volunteers had already set up large canopies with tables of food - sandwiches, chips, fruit salad, cookies, and drinks. Our teacher, Mrs. Johnson, allowed us 30 minutes to eat before we were released to go play games. My best friend Sam and I scarfed down our lunch so we could have more time to go on the swings and jungle gym.\\\\n\\\\nAfter lunch, some of the parents organized games like sack races, three-legged races, and a water balloon toss. I wasn't very good at the races but I loved the water balloon toss. My partner was my friend Lucy and even though we didn't win, we had fun getting splashed whenever a balloon broke.\\\\n\\\\nThe picnic ended with popsicles and graduation certificates handed out by Mrs. Johnson. We took a big class picture together under one of the canopies. Then it was time to clean up and get picked up by our parents. I was tired from running around all day but also sad that I wouldn't see my friends everyday anymore. It was a fun last day of school.
